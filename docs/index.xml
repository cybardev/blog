Think of arrays like a row of cardboard boxes. These boxes can be used to store different types of data - ints, Strings, even custom data types like Person.
One important thing to note is that you can only have a constant number of these boxes for each array you make. While making the array, if you tell Java that this array will have 10 items, then that array will always be able to contain upto 10 items - no more, no less, no changes to this size.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to my blog</title><link>https://cybarspace.github.io/blog/first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 14:38:01 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://cybarspace.github.io/blog/first-post/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s this about? Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just going to be me and my thoughts. Won&amp;rsquo;t be regular, but I do want to use this as a diary of sorts so might make frequent but short posts every now and then. I will mostly post about computers and technology since that is my field of interest. Sometimes I might also post about science and pop culture.
Who are you? An undergrad computer science student from Bangladesh who loves Linux and all things science and tech.</description></item></channel></rss>
