      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s this about? Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just going to be me and my thoughts. Won&amp;rsquo;t be regular, but I do want to use this as a diary of sorts so might make frequent but short posts every now and then. I will mostly post about computers and technology since that is my field of interest. Sometimes I might also post about science and pop culture.
Who are you? An undergrad computer science student from Bangladesh who loves Linux and all things science and tech.</description>
